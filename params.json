Currently, it uses a _handshake system_ to connect one Telegram private chat/group with another one. DiteCross must be added to each Telegram and Discord groups in order to process your messages and relay them to the linked chat.\r\n\r\n### How do I make the handshake?\r\n1. To get started, add [DiteCross](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=204892560475422730&scope=bot&permissions=3072) to your Discord server\r\n2. Contact [@DiteCross_bot](https://telegram.me/DiteCross_bot) on Telegram and, if you have a group, add the bot to it\r\n2. Type the command `/handshake` on Telegram chat\r\n3. The bot will ask `What is the server and the channel you want to handshake?`. Simply send a message like `@MyFunnyServer#crosschannel` where `MyFunnyServer` is the target Discord's server name and `crosschannel` the target channel name\r\n4. Go to Discord and type `/handshake` to confirm and link the groups\r\n5. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nNote: If you want to revert back, you can type anytime the command `/cancel`. DiteCross will confirm with a message like `Handshake cancelled`.\r\n\r\n### How do I self host?\r\nDiteCross is Open Source, so you can self host it by yourself.
